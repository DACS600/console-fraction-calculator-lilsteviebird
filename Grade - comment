Grade: check / check minus

1 - Your user interface is fairly minimal.  I can do one operation and then the program closes down. It appears to work well though
for addition.  How about letting me do other operations.  I see you implemented them.
2 - Your code looks good and complete for the fraction class and the fraction calculator class.
3 - Add some comments to let me know what things mean (or choose better variable names ... what does basefraac mean?)
